## Installation

To install HW-PiCollector, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PRATIK123213/HW-PiCollector.git
   cd HW-PiCollector
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use Ansible to set up the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook setup.yml
   ```

3. **Configure Your Devices**:

   Ensure your HomeWizard devices are connected and configured properly.

## Usage

To start collecting data, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will initiate the data collection process. You can check the logs for any errors or issues.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located in the `config` directory. You can edit `config.yaml` to set your device parameters and data storage options.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
homewizard:
  device_id: "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"

storage:
  type: "cassandra"
  host: "localhost"
  port: 9042
```

## Data Storage

HW-PiCollector supports various data storage options. By default, it uses Cassandra for time-series data. You can configure this in the `config.yaml` file. 

### Setting Up Cassandra

To set up Cassandra, follow these steps:

1. **Install Cassandra**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install cassandra
   ```

2. **Start Cassandra**:

   ```bash
   sudo service cassandra start
   ```

3. **Create Keyspace**:

   Connect to Cassandra and create a keyspace for storing data.

   ```sql
   CREATE KEYSPACE energy_data WITH REPLICATION = { 'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1 };
   ```

## Monitoring and Visualization

To visualize your energy data, you can use Grafana or any other visualization tool compatible with your data storage solution.

### Setting Up Grafana

1. **Install Grafana**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install grafana
   ```

2. **Start Grafana**:

   ```bash
   sudo service grafana-server start
   ```

3. **Access Grafana**:

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. Use the default login credentials to access the dashboard.

4. **Add Data Source**:

   Configure Grafana to connect to your Cassandra database.
